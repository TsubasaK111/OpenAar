# OpenAar
OpenAAR is a platform for organizations to plan, share, and review projects to extract Lessons Learned. 

Because OpenAAR:

* Structures the discussion
* Allows customized frameworks
* Scales to accomodate projects of any scale,

OpenAAR will help you squeeze every last drop of learning out of all of your crucial projects, ops, and simulations,
whether you are Special Operations, a Strategy Consultant, an IT Red Team, or just a Project Team in need of some reflection.

Conduct After Action Review cycles and <a href="https://hbr.org/2005/07/learning-in-the-thick-of-it">learn in the thick of it</a>!
